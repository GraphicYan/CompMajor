Geometric optimization via composite majorization
=================================================

This is a small Matlab and C++ implementation of the mesh parameterization method presented in "[Geometric optimization via composite majorization](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3073618)" (Shtengel et al. 2017). The Matlab code compares all previous optimization methods mentioned in the paper for the symmetric Dirichlet energy. The C++ contains an intereactive parameterization GUI which uses this method. More energies and functionality will be added in the future.
